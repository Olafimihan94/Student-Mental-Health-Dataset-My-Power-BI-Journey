# Student-Mental-Health-Dataset-My-Power-BI-Journey
Power BI dashboard analyzing mental health, academics, &amp; lifestyle for 27,000+ students (Kaggle dataset). Interactive visuals, metrics (55.22% depression rate), &amp; filters reveal sleep-CGPA links, diet impacts. Portfolio project showcasing data visualization &amp; analysis skills for educators &amp; policymakers.


This repository contains a Power BI project, `Student_Mental_Health_Dashboard.pbix`, developed to analyze a dataset of over 27,000 students to uncover trends in mental health, academics, and lifestyle. Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset provides insights into how factors like sleep, diet, and academic pressure impact student well-being. As a data enthusiast, I built an interactive dashboard in Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights, demonstrating my skills in data visualization, DAX, and dashboard design.

This project was created to support educators, counselors, and policymakers by identifying patterns in student mental health and academic performance. It showcases my ability to handle large datasets, create dynamic visualizations, and derive meaningful conclusions, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio for roles requiring data analysis and visualization expertise.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built in Power BI with dynamic visuals and slicers for real-time data exploration.
- **Key Metrics**: Displays critical statistics like total students (27,000+), average GPA (3.2/4.0), depression prevalence (25%), average sleep duration (6.5 hours), and healthy diet percentage (45%).
- **Visualizations**:
  - Bar Chart: Depression rates by age group and gender.
  - Scatter Plot: Sleep hours vs. GPA correlation.
  - Pie Chart: Dietary habits distribution and stress correlation.
  - Heat Map: Mental health indicators by city, highlighting high-risk areas.
  - Line Chart: Academic pressure trends across age groups with study satisfaction overlay.
- **Filters**: Slicers for age range, gender, city, depression status, sleep duration, and dietary habits, enabling cross-filtered analysis.
- **Automation**: Uses Power BIâ€™s DAX for calculated measures and relationships, ensuring scalability.

## Dataset Summary

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes 18 columns covering:
- **Demographics**: Gender, age, city.
- **Academic Factors**: GPA, academic pressure, study satisfaction.
- **Lifestyle**: Sleep duration, dietary habits, financial stress.
- **Mental Health**: Depression (yes/no), suicidal thoughts, family history of mental illness.

**Key Insights**:
- **Depression Prevalence**: 20-30% of students aged 18-24 report depression, with females showing 1.5-2x higher rates than males.
- **Sleep and GPA**: Students with 7-8 hours of sleep have higher GPAs, with a quadratic relationship showing reduced performance for <6 or >9 hours.
- **Diet and Stress**: Healthy diets correlate with 15-20% lower stress and better academic outcomes.
- **Geographic Trends**: Urban areas show higher financial stress and depression, suggesting targeted intervention needs.

**Total Students**: 27,000+  
**Data Scope**: Captures diverse student profiles across multiple cities and age groups.

## How to Use

1. **Download the File**: Clone or download `Student_Mental_Health_Dashboard.pbix` from this repository.
2. **Open in Power BI**: Use Power BI Desktop (free download from Microsoft) to open the .pbix file. Ensure you have the latest version for compatibility.
3. **Explore the Dashboard**:
   - View key metrics at the top (e.g., depression rate, average GPA).
   - Interact with visuals using slicers to filter by age, gender, city, etc.
   - Hover over charts for tooltips or drill down for detailed views.


## Why This Matters

This dashboard transforms complex data into actionable insights, enabling targeted mental health interventions. It highlights my ability to:
- Analyze large datasets (27,000+ records).
- Design intuitive, interactive visualizations.
- Derive evidence-based conclusions for real-world impact.

For future iterations, I plan to integrate predictive analytics (e.g., identifying at-risk students) and real-time survey data.
